def _walk_paths(static_path, fmt):
    """
    Recursively walks and finds all paths relative to the combination of
    static_path and fmt.

    :param static_path {string, filepath} A static path defined by the tdf
    system. An example is request.static_path('tdf:public/css').
    :param fmt {string} A string with two format replacements %s. This is used
    to create a full path to the system. The first %s is replaced with the
    current working directory, and teh second is replaced by the static path.
    For example, if the directory that needs to be walked is
    /home/user/pytdf/tdf/public/css/, where /home/user/pytdf is the current
    working directory and /public/css is the static path, then the format
    code given should be '%s/tdf%s/*' indicating that all files and
    subdirectories in the desired folder should be walked.

    :return files {array of string} An array of filepaths, relative to
    static_path of all files (including those found in subdirectories) found.
    For example, if we are walking the css folder organized as follows:
        css/
            common.css
            other.css
            subdir/

                b.css
            subdir2/
                c.css
    The returned array would be:
        ['common.css', 'other.css', 'subdir/a.css', 'subdir/b.css',
         'subdir2/c.css']
